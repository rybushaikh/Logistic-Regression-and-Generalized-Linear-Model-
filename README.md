# Logistic-Regression-and-Generalized-Linear-Model-
Using R's glm() function, we applied the classification method of logistic regression for this project.
By adding a link function, logistic regression expands the framework of general linear regression to represent the relationship between predictor variables and a categorical response variable. We attempted to predict whether a university is private or public based on a variety of predictor characteristics by using a logistic regression model.

When the response variable is binary or categorical in character, logistic regression is especially helpful since it enables us to calculate the likelihood of a specific result. It offers a useful tool for comprehending the connection between predictor factors and the probability of falling into a particular category.

We sought to accomplish several important learning objectives through this assignment, including the extension of generic linear regression to take into account non-normal error distribution models (CLO10) and the use of a link function to connect the linear model to the response variable (CLO11). To gain expertise using logistic regression for classification problems (CLO12), we modeled the connection between predictor variables and the categorical answer variable.

Overall, this task gave students the chance to apply logistic regression for categorization goals, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical abilities. We used the R glm() function to analyze the data, interpret the findings, and evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting the classification of the university (private or public).
